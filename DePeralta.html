            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello there! I'm Jhaydee, a passionate computer science student with a deep curiosity for the world of web development. As a perpetual learner, I thrive on the excitement of exploring new concepts and technologies every day. While I may be a beginner in the realm of web development, I embrace the challenges and opportunities it offers to expand my knowledge and skills. With each line of code I write and each project I undertake, I'm on a journey of continuous growth, working towards becoming a proficient web developer. I'm enthusiastic about the ever-evolving field of technology and can't wait to see where my educational and creative endeavors take me next.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                As a student, my experiences have been primarily centered around my academic journey, but they have been invaluable in shaping my skills and outlook. I've had the opportunity to delve into various computer science courses, which have given me a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures. 

I've also participated in student projects and hackathons, collaborating with my peers to tackle real-world problems. These experiences have not only honed my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

Furthermore, I've had the privilege of being part of student organizations related to computer science and technology, where I've attended workshops, seminars, and networking events. These interactions have broadened my horizons and provided me with insights into the vast possibilities in the tech industry.

While I'm still a student and consider myself a beginner in web development, I'm excited to continue learning, growing, and applying my knowledge to real-world projects. I believe that the experiences I've gained as a student will serve as a strong foundation for my future endeavors in the field of computer science.
